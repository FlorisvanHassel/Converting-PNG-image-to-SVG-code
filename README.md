# Converting-PNG-image-to-SVG-code
Converting PNG image to SVG code with using a Neural Network (CCN/LSTM network)

This was an individual assignment for the course Deep Learning at my university, and the first task I have every done with sequences modeling.
I know that my network is trained on PNG images that don't have shapes that are completly covered by other shapes (and therefore not visible anymore), but if I had more time than I would have solved that problem also. Also it didn't seem to matter alot on the test data, the CER score I got on my own test batch was +- 1% lower than the one on the test set from the professor (I knowingly toke that for granted).  
I could have optimised this script alot, but due to lack of time this is was I ended up with (e.g learn the network to predict when a figures is hidden behind an other figure once it got the shapes and colors right, optimise the network more.). 

Also this got me to the 3th spot on the rankings, so I was quite pleased with that.

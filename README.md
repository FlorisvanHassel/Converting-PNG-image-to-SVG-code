# Converting-PNG-image-to-SVG-code
Converting PNG image to SVG code with using a Neural Network (CCN/LSTM network)

This was an individual assignment for the course Deep Learning at my university, and the first task I have every done with sequences modeling.
I know that my network is not trained on images that have shapes that are completly covered by other shapes (and therefore not visible anymore), but if I had more time than I would have solved that problem also. Also it didn't seem to matter alot on the test data, the CER score I got on my own test batch was +- 1% lower than the one on the test set from the professor (So I knowingly toke that for granted).  
I could have optimised this script alot, but due to lack of time this is was I ended up with (e.g learn the network to predict when a figures is hidden behind an other figure once it got the shapes and colors right). 

Also this got me to the 3th spot on the rankings, so I was quite pleased with that.
